# RockPaperScissor (The Game)

### This Repo will hold my Rock Paper Scissor project.
### This game can be played directly after launching site. It is a best of 5 (3 wins and game ends)
### Google-Chrome Dev tools console shows output for player & computer choices, scores, loss value, and result of game.

## To Do / Needs Review
- Looking to add onclick method where border color for player / comp surrounds selected Img (or button?)
            onclick="winnerColor(this.id)"
